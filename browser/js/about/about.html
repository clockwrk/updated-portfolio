    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <div class='jumbotron shadow'>
        <h2> Allow me to introduce myself</h2>
        <p> After moving to New York City from Los Angeles in 2013, I started getting into technology by joining Per Scholas Institute of Technology to learn computer repair and networking. I finished my Comptia A+ and Network+ certifications but found I had more of an interest in the software side of technology. Therefore, I enrolled and graduated from Kingsborough Community College CUNY in Fall of 2015 with an Associates in Computer Science. At that point I considered myself to be an intermediate coder but wanted to program at a more professional level so I joined Fullstack Academy in 2016. There I acquired in-depth knowledge of front-end development, back-end development, databases, developer tools and gained collaborative project experience. Now I am seeking a full time, entry-level position in front-end development. I would also like to flesh out my portfolio with freelance work. If you would like to hire me you can contact me at <a href="mailto:Jrenteria2016@outlook.com">Jrenteria2016@outlook.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am obsessed with learning React.js, mobile development and reading Hacker news. Enjoy meeting with other developers in the New York City tech meet up scene and finding opportunities to collaborate on projects. I also work out regularly, practice archery and play old school video games when I have the free time.
